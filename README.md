# JTT Algorithm Implementation with PyTorch Lightning

This project implements the JTT (Just Train Twice) algorithm based on the research paper:

**[Just Train Twice: Improving Group Robustness without Training Group Information](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.09044.pdf)**

For a PyTorch implementation of the same algorithm, refer to the repository: [JTT-PyTorch Implementation](https://github.com/annakhosrovyan/Improving-Group-Robustness)
